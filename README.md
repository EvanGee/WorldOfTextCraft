This is a text based adventure Engine that I built for the lols a while back.
However, Now I attached a crypto currency module to it. That allows one to use items serialized on the blockchain!
It works as a stand alone text based engine, however, there are a couple functions you need to define before it will work,
will add proper documentation soon.

This probably doesn't work anymore:

./server python3 main.py

and connect to it with it.

./client 127.0.0.1:1111

If you want to use a better client I hav something in the works
